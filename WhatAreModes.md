# What Are Modes?

Anytone radios have 18 or more modes which are used to the set the country's base setting, operating bands and band edges for transmit and receive. The codeplug software then adhears to those basic parameters within a codeplug. Both the radio and codeplug modes must match.

George County ARES with two different codeplugs for the Anytone D878UVII Plus radio. Mode 7 and Mode 14 codeplugs. Mode 7 is for a stock radio that hasn't been unlocked and Mode 14 which is basically a MARS modification, plus it opens up the 220 MHz band (tri-band).

> [!WARNING]
> George County ARES is not responsible for anyone who decides to use these codeplugs and operates outside of the FCC rules.
