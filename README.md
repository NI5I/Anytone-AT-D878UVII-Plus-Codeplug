# Anytone-AT-D878UVII-Plus-Mode-14-Codeplug

Unofficial Mississippi ARES codeplug for the Anytone AT-D878UVII Plus radio.

This codeplug is a work in progress, please reach out to me if you notice any inaccuracies or would like to add repeaters in your Mississippi County.

## Introduction
This codeplug was started as a personal codeplug, then added entries for the George County ARES group when they got their DMR repeater back on the air. Now the focus has been shifted to make something for the State of Mississippi ARES team. Our intentions are to add all Mississippi Counties to the codeplug.

Mississippi ARES EC's please reach out to me and let me know how you would like your county's zone configured.

## Features
1295 Channels
1165 Talk Groups
64 Zones

Most US BrandMeister talk groups are included, I have just started adding talk groups from TGIF and FreeDMR networks.

George County zone included
Stone County zone is next
Forest County zone is in the works
Lamar County zone is also in the works

Did I mention that this is a a codeplug for the state of Mississippi?

## Use
This codeplug (RDT file) is for the Anytone AT-D878UVII Plus radio with firmware version 3.03 running CPS version 3.03 and the radio is configured for Mode 14 (Maintenance Mode).

If your radio is not configured for Mode 14, this codeplug file cannot be installed onto your radio. We do provide all of the exported .CSV files that you may import directly into your codeplug and achieve the same results.

If there is enough interest, I may start another project to support Mode 7 (US Amateur Radio mode).
